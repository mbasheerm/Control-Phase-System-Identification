# Control-Phase-System-Identification
This project focuses on system identification of a quadrotor UAV, based on a second order plus integrator and time delay model, for the altitude channel. This deals with identifying the system parameters based on control phase relay considering the transient response and the limit cycle oscillations for the system.
